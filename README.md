Project Goals
 • Build a multilingual, SEO-optimized, modular website using Astro and React.
 • Serve as a central hub for international buyers to discover, evaluate, and directly engage with German manufacturers.
 • Enable centralized ordering, container shipping, and a professional B2B user experience.
 • Provide a technical structure that supports franchise-based localization for over 50 countries, each with its own domain or subdomain.

Technical Stack
 • Astro for static site generation and SSR
 • React for dynamic components and UI interaction
 • Custom Web Components for shared sections (e.g. Cookie Banner, Headers)
 • Hosted on GitHub with continuous updates via Pull Requests
